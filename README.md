Dear all

In this repository we provide the data as well as the source code employed for performing the experiment in the paper entitled “Metrics for Evaluating Quality of Embeddings forOntological Concepts” submitted to ISWC

We have three primary tasks,

1)	Task1: Categorization aspects 
2)	Task2: Hierarchical aspects
3)	Task3: Relational aspects
The raw data for each task is represented in the three sub-floders named Task 1, Task2 and Task 3


The vectors trained by skip-gram, CBOW, RDF2VEC and GloVe are provided in the following links:
•	http://tsoru.aksw.org/concept2vec/ 
•	http://tsoru.aksw.org/concept2vec/glove/output/task1/ 
•	http://tsoru.aksw.org/concept2vec/glove/output/task2/ 
•	 http://tsoru.aksw.org/concept2vec/glove/output/task3/ 


Code Folder contains python source code employed for computations.
